Hey there! This is the shorter Project Summary of my Word Clock Project!

So to start off, here's an example to give you the gist:
###### (note: ignore the quotation marks, they are used to highlight words)

```js
"e s"H"i s t"G f ü n f
 z e h n"z w a n z i g"
 v i e r t e l E"v o r"
 n a c h Ä h a l b X I
 z w e i n"s i e b e n"
 e l f ü n f z w ö l f
 z e h n e u n d r e i
 a c h t P L s e c h s
 v i e r u h r S Y N C
```

If you look at all the letters, you can see how this clock works. It has all words that are required to spell out every time of the day with 5 minutes accuracy on it, allowing you to display the time by highlighting some of the words (see the [example](#(note:-ignore-the-quotation-marks,-they-are-used-to-highlight-words))). And that's basically it.

But making it a real thing isnt that easy, because you need to do x things:
1. [Make a letter matrix with all words on it, with the least possible amount of letters.](#For-more-infos-and-the-full-documentation-go-to-the-full-summary)
2. [Make a program that gives you the time in words.](#For-more-infos-and-the-full-documentation-go-to-the-full-summary)
3. [Make a program that displays the words on the matrix.](#For-more-infos-and-the-full-documentation-go-to-the-full-summary)
4. [Display the matrix on a real LED Matrix](#For-more-infos-and-the-full-documentation-go-to-the-full-summary)
5. [Displaying the current time on the clock](#For-more-infos-and-the-full-documentation-go-to-the-full-summary)

The materials that I'll need aren't a lot and i already have a lot of it, although I'm currently a bit unsure if I'm building the LED Matrix myself.
- 11x9 1-colored LEDs (like 5-15€ depending on the color, brightness etc.)
- Probably just wood for the casing, at the front Balsa wood, and at the back just any wood (like 5€ max because we have a lot of wood, except for the balsa wood, at home)
- Arduino (0€, already have one)
- Power supply (0€, i can just use a powerbank)
- Maybe an LED Matrix (if i cant build the matrix myself, but i think i could pull it off)
All in all, its about 10-20€ maximum.
